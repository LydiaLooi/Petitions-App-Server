## Running locally

1. Use `npm install` to populate the `node_modules/` directory with up-to-date packages
2. Create a file called `.env`, following the instructions in the section below
3. Go to https://dbadmin.csse.canterbury.ac.nz and create a database with the name that you set in the `.env` file
2. Run `npm run start` or `npm run debug` to start the server
3. The server will be accessible on `localhost:4941`

### `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project including the following information (note that you will need to create the database first in phpMyAdmin):

```
SENG365_MYSQL_HOST=db2.csse.canterbury.ac.nz
SENG365_MYSQL_USER={your usercode}
SENG365_MYSQL_PASSWORD={your password}
SENG365_MYSQL_DATABASE={a database starting with your usercode then an underscore}
```

For example:
```
SENG365_MYSQL_HOST=db2.csse.canterbury.ac.nz
SENG365_MYSQL_USER=abc123
SENG365_MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
SENG365_MYSQL_DATABASE=abc123_main
```
